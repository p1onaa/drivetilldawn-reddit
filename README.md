An experimental starter that explores a new way to build applications on Reddit's developer platform.

- [Devvit](https://developers.reddit.com/): A way to build and deploy immersive games on Reddit
- [Vite](https://vite.dev/): For compiling the webView
- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/): For 3D animations and physics
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/): For backend logic
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): For type safety

4. `cd your-app-name`

6. **Make a subreddit**: Make a private subreddit on Reddit.com. This will be where you do your own development. Go to Reddit.com, scroll the left side bar down to communities, and click "Create a community."
7. **Update the name in package.json**: Find the `dev:devvit` command and replace `YOUR_SUBREDDIT_NAME` with the subreddit name you just created.
8. **Upload**: Run `npm run deploy` and go through the prompts
9. **Playtest**: Run `npm run dev` to playtest your application in production by going to your subreddit.
10. **Create Post**: Use the subreddit menu action called "TowerBlocks: New Post" to create the post.

## Commands

- `npm run dev`: Starts a development server where you can develop your application live on Reddit.
- `npm run deploy`: Uploads a new version of your app
- `npm run check`: Type checks, lints, and prettifies your app

## Cursor Integration
